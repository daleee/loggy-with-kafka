# Loggy with Kafka

## Prerequisites
* Git
* Node/NPM 0.12

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04. If you're on OS X or a distro not based on Debian,
you'll have to install Zookeeper, Kafka and PostgreSQL manually.

## Installation
1) Clone repo
2) `cd` into repo & run `[sudo] npm install`. This should also install additional dependencies such as Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL so `sudo` may be required for this step.

## Usage
Start the API server with `npm start`.
You can run tests with `npm test`.
Run the linter with `npm run lint`.
